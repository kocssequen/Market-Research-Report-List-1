<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oral Drug Delivery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diffusion Controlled Release System</li><li>Dissolution Controlled Release System</li><li>Ion Exchange Resins Controlled Release</li><li>Hydro-dynamically Balanced Drug Delivery System</li><li>Osmotically Controlled Release System</li><li>Dissolution & Diffusion Controlled Release System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oral drug delivery market features various controlled release systems. Diffusion-controlled release systems rely on drug molecules diffusing through a matrix, while dissolution-controlled systems depend on the solubility of the drug in the gastrointestinal fluid. Ion exchange resins facilitate controlled release through ionic interactions. Hydro-dynamically balanced systems utilize buoyancy to prolong gastric retention. Osmotically controlled systems use osmotic pressure to release drugs at a steady rate. Finally, dissolution and diffusion-controlled systems integrate both mechanisms for enhanced delivery efficacy.</p></p>
