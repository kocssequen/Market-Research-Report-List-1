<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PI Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PI fibers, or polyimide fibers, are categorized into two primary market types based on the spinning process: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving the polymer in a solvent and extruding it into a coagulation bath, leading to high-quality fibers ideal for applications requiring excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance. Dry spinning, on the other hand, involves the evaporation of a solvent after fiber extrusion, producing lighter fibers suitable for various industrial applications while maintaining decent thermal properties.</p></p>
